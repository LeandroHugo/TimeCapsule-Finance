# 🚀💼 Time Lock Wallet - Empowering Your Financial Freedom

![Alt text](Images/TimeClock.png)

## 📜 Project Proposal

### Background 🌌🔍

In a world of impulsive spending and financial stress, we need a revolutionary tool to help users take control of their finances and achieve their savings goals. Whether the users are governed by certain set of policies by bank or by guardians of the accounts (Ex: Parents taking ownership of minor accounts) we want to provide an option for locking the wallet for certain period of time.

### Project Title 🏆🔐

TimeCapsule - A Time Lock Wallet

### Objective 🎯

The objective of this project is to develop a time lock wallet using Ethereum's Solidity language. The wallet will allow users to deposit funds and set a lock time. The funds cannot be withdrawn until the lock time has elapsed. This can help users save money for specific goals and prevent impulsive spending decisions.

### Scope of Work 🛠️

1. **Learning Phase:** 📚 Understand the basics of Solidity, the programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Refer to the [Ethereum Developer Resources](https://ethereum.org/developers/) for more information.

2. **Environment Setup:** 🛠️ Set up the development environment including Node.js, npm, Truffle, and Ganache. Utilize the resources from [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/aantonop/ethereumbook) to master the Ethereum ecosystem.

3. **Smart Contract Development:** 💡 Write a smart contract in Solidity that implements the time lock wallet. The contract will include functions to deposit funds, set the lock time, and withdraw funds. Practice Solidity with [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) and [Solidity by Example](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html).

4. **Testing:** ✅ Write tests for the smart contract to ensure it works as expected. The tests will check that funds can be deposited and withdrawn correctly, and that the time lock is enforced.

5. **Deployment:** 🚀 Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain using Truffle and Infura. Explore [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) for decentralized file storage.

6. **Interaction:** 🤝 Interact with the deployed smart contract using Web3.js. Develop a web-based user interface for the time lock wallet using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/).

7. **User Interface Development :** 🌐 Develop a web-based user interface for the time lock wallet to make it more accessible to users.

8. **Machine learning :** 🌐 We will use APIs to get last 1 year ethereum price and use that to forecast value in the next 10 days. When user tries to withdraw funds, we will show potential price drop or increase and ask if withdraw should continue to happen. 

9. **Interest Rate :** We can add an interest rate to the deposited amount. The longer the funds stay in the wallet, the more interest they accrue.
10. **Multi-signature Wallet :** We can turn this into a multi-signature wallet, where multiple parties need to agree before funds can be withdrawn.
11. **Emergency Stop :** We can add a "circuit breaker" or "pause" function that allows the owner to stop certain functionalities in case of an emergency.
12. **Withdrawal Limit :** We can add a daily withdrawal limit to prevent all funds from being withdrawn at once.
13. **Token Support :** We can add support for ERC20 tokens in addition to Ether.


### Timeline ⏳

The estimated timeline for this project is 6-8 weeks but we only have 2 weeks to get this done. This includes time for learning, development, testing, and deployment.

### Budget 💰

The budget will primarily cover the cost of deploying the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain, which involves gas fees.

### Expected Outcomes 🏁

At the end of this project, we will have a functioning time lock wallet that users can interact with to deposit funds, set a lock time, and withdraw funds after the lock time has elapsed. This will provide a tool for users to manage their spending and save money for specific goals.

### Future Work 🔮

Future enhancements could include adding additional features to the wallet, such as the ability to add multiple time locks or to lock different types of assets. We could also develop a mobile app interface for the wallet to make it even more accessible.
