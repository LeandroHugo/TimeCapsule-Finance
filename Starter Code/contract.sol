// In this version, the deposit function no longer takes an amount argument.
// Instead, it uses the msg.value directly from the transaction, which is the usual way to handle deposits in Solidity.

// The withdraw function now only withdraws the entire balance of the contract and resets the balance to zero.
// Also, the lockTime comparison has been changed to >= to allow for withdrawal exactly at lockTime.

// I've made the deadmanSwitch function reset the lockTime to zero, allowing immediate withdrawal.
// This is just an example, you should replace it with your desired functionality.

// Lastly, the fallback function now calls the deposit function,
// meaning any Ether sent to the contract without data will be treated as a deposit.
